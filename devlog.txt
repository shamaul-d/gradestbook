ShamaulD -- 2017-01-12
  code breaking, as well as starting changes on login

VannaM -- 2017-01-12

ShamaulD -- 2017-01-13
  login and auth functions are fully working now! Until we change stuff, that is

  gen. bug fixes

ShamaulD -- 2017-01-15
  cleanup in app! (ahem thanks Vanna)

ShamaulD -- 2017-01-17
  realized I need functions! 
  like tid, sid, nm, seid. 
  also realized doing class stuff should precede student work
 
VannaM -- 2017-01-17
  realized (again) that some of my stuff is irrelevant, deleted
  joinClass works from frontend
  it doesn't actually add you to a class though, bc we don't have classes yet

NicoleC -- 2017-01-17
  print functions
  checking functions to verify existence
  distinction between classes and periods

NicoleC -- 2017-01-18
  reset database
  adding everything works
  getclassest(tid) returns list of classes of a teacher
  getclassess(sid) returns list of classes of a student
  getcid() gets the next class id to be used

JamesY -- 2017-01-18
  fixed formatting for some html pages
  changed some css in bootstrap files.

NicoleC -- 2017-01-19
  reformatted and reorganized database.py
  list of all functions are at the top of the file for ref
  changeseat() and changegrade() working
